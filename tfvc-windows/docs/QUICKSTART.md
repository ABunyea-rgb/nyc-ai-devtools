# TFVC Quickstart (Windows)

Visual Studio is the recommended Windows client. You do not need the PowerShell scripts to use TFVC.

## Connect and get the code

1. Install Visual Studio and sign in with the account that has access to the Azure DevOps organization.
2. In Visual Studio, open **View > Team Explorer**. In Team Explorer, choose **Manage Connections > Connect to a Project**.
3. Select the Azure DevOps organization/server and project, then choose **Connect**.
4. On the TFVC project page, choose **Configure your workspace**. Select a local folder and map the server path you need.
5. Choose **Map & Get** to download the code.

## Work and check in

Open **Team Explorer > Home > Pending Changes** (Ctrl+0, P). Review **Included Changes** and **Excluded Changes**, enter a useful comment, associate a work item if required by your team, then choose **Check In**. The successful check-in creates a changeset.

## Publish from pitcrew-dcwp

Use this workflow to copy merged changes from the Git mirror into the mapped TFVC workspace. Run these commands from **Git Bash**. Stop the local stack first so temporary overlays are reverted.

Publishing sends only the files changed in git between the `synced-to-tfvc` tag (the last commit checked in to TFVC) and `origin/main`, using their committed content. Build output, caches, and uncommitted edits are never copied, and you don't need to have `main` checked out.

1. Get latest in TFVC (Team Explorer, or `bash "$TFVC_TOOLS/tfvc.sh" get . /recursive`) and confirm there are no pending changes.

2. From the mirror repository, preview the publish:

   ```bash
   cd /c/Users/[path to repo base]/pitcrew-dcwp
   npm run publish:dry-run
   ```

   The preview lists the merged PRs and each file as `add`, `edit`, `delete`, `already` (TFVC already matches), or `drift`. Drift means the TFVC file changed after the last sync, so overwriting it would lose that change. Compare it with the git versions, then rerun with `-- --skip-drift` and merge it by hand. Use `-- --force` only if you're sure the TFVC change should be replaced.

   To publish a different range, pass `-- --base <commit> --head <commit>`.

3. Apply and print the comment template:

   ```bash
   npm run publish:apply
   npm run publish:checkin-note
   ```

   `publish:apply` copies files into the TFVC workspace and prints `tf add` / `tf delete` commands for new and removed files. It doesn't create a changeset. To undo it, run `npm run publish:rollback`.

4. Pend new and deleted files, then review:

   ```bash
   export TFVC_TOOLS=/c/Users/[path to repo]/nyc-ai-devtools/tfvc-windows/scripts
   cd /c/Users/[path to tfvc workspace]/DEV-OTI
   bash "$TFVC_TOOLS/tfvc.sh" add "<path from publish:apply>"
   bash "$TFVC_TOOLS/tfvc.sh" status . /recursive
   ```

   The pending changes should match the files from step 2 that weren't `already`. In **Team Explorer > Pending Changes**, don't promote other detected files.

5. Enter the comment (one sentence per change, PR numbers in parentheses, for example `Add Click-to-Cancel submit timeout handling and timeout error page (PR #132).`) and select **Check In**.

6. Record the check-in so the next publish starts from it:

   ```bash
   cd /c/Users/[path to repo base]/pitcrew-dcwp
   npm run publish:mark-synced -- <changeset number>
   ```

   This moves the `synced-to-tfvc` tag to the commit you published and pushes it, so everyone's next publish uses the same starting point.
